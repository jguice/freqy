reusable library
configuration (file, env, in-line)
- word length (1-n)
- word chunk
extensible (multiple implementations like each, line, etc.)
could parallelize
- break input into chunks at whitespace boundary
- could use single db like dynamo w/ n number of processor instances
- could also have separate data stores and recombine results (need to store more than top 100 from each though, in case cumulative amount is top-100 but individually not)

Ordering
- ordering when multiple phrases tie for count will be in order of accumulation in text (which is scanned beginning to end)
- in the case of parallel processing, this would be more randomized (by completion time on particular nodes)
