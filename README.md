# freqy

Freqy (freaky) is a word or phrase frequency analyzer.  It reads an input text file and identifies the top N words or 
multi-word sequences.  It is designed to be efficient on large files and can potentially be parallelized to further
improve performance.

## Quickstart
Assuming you have a modern ruby interpreter and bundler installed... (see [Technologies](#technologies) below for details).

### Clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/jguice/freqy.git
```
(or use your favorite git client)

### Install dependencies
```
bundle install
```

### Run the app
Pass files to scan as arguments, or text via STDIN.

#### file arguments
```
./freqy.rb file1.txt file2.txt ...
```

#### STDIN
```
cat file1.txt | ./freqy.rb
```

**NOTE:** Beware of possible undesirable behavior using this method with large files.

## Configuration
Configuration is internal to the code at the moment.  Likely elements to extract a file or environment-based config:
- "word" delimiters
- number of "words" in a phrase
- chunk size
- characters to ignore (remove)

## Documentation
Internal documentation can be generated by running the `yard` command and opening `index.html` in the generated `doc` dir. 

## Technologies

### ruby
freqy is built and tested using ruby 2.5.1 but should run on most modern rubies.  The runtime environment is setup with 
[chruby](https://github.com/postmodern/chruby) which will [auto-switch](https://github.com/postmodern/chruby#auto-switching)
to the appropriate ruby version if configured (and installed).

### Bundler
[Bundler](https://bundler.io) manages dependencies for freqy.

### RSpec
[RSpec](http://rspec.info) is the test framework used to validate freqy behavior/requirements.

## Development / Testing

### Dev Environment setup
Initial steps for setup of development environment (macOS).  Note that [rubocop](https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop)
is used a static code linter, but is not required.

#### install...

- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)
- chruby: `brew install chruby`
- ruby-install: `brew install ruby-install`
- ruby-2.5.1: `ruby-install ruby-2.5.1`

**NOTE:** At this point you'll likely need to open a new terminal window for chruby auto-versioning to work.

- bundler:`gem install bundler`
- dependencies: `bundle install --binstubs`

#### running tests

To run project tests:
```
./bin/rspec
```

### Performance
The current implementation attempts to maximize performance while keeping the code relatively simple and short.  Ultimately a [benchmark](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.5.1/libdoc/benchmark/rdoc/Benchmark.html) should be conducted against some known input sets, and various implementations tested.

Current choices related to performance:
- lazy file evaluation (read on-demand instead of up-front)
- "chunking" of reads into batches (vs. character-at-a-time)
- gsub specific unwanted characters with empty string (vs. a list of accepted chars)
- minimal intermediate storage (only ever storing phrase_size + 1 elements during frequency scan)

Some possible options for further improving the algorithm (individual thread):
- Using `tr` instead of `gsub` to replace (remove) unwanted characters.
- Utilize a [StringScanner](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.5.3/libdoc/strscan/rdoc/StringScanner.html) on the input stream directly.

### Extending
The `WordAnalyzer` class could be extended "upwards" by generalizing a parent class that could analyze the frequency of
things besides words (space character boundary in-betweens).

You'll also find a stub in WordAnalyzer for an adaptive chunking implementation (and some notes) illustrating how to 
plug in alternate implementations behind the WordAnalyzer interface.
